This was a project developed for the course [AIAD]. The goal was to create
an agent-based predator-prey ecosystem simulation.

The images show several rabbits populations with different sets of rules
where green represents the amount of grass available on that zone,
orange represents the passive foxes population and red the ones that are
hunting.
