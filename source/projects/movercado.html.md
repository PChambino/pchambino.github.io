This project was started by [PSI/Mozambique] and eventually became its own organization named [Triggerise].

*Movercado* is a platform to dynamically compose SMS interactions and an integrated loyalty system, with the goal of creating an eco-system designed to increase efficiency of aid delivery at the bottom of the pyramid using local markets and SMS.
