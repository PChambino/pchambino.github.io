This was a project developed for the course [LDSO]. The goal was to solve the
problem of obtaining schedule and route information about public transport
in a fast and intuitive way. The data used is based on the city of Porto but
it is incomplete and not reliable.

A website, a mobile web version, and an Android native application were made.

The website can be found online at <http://portoinmotion.heroku.com>.
