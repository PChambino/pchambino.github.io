During the [LGPR] course we created a *pretend* company named *Techmine*.
As a member of this company I was responsible for implementing the company's
website based on Jo√£o Pereira's design.

The project involved a lot of animations and effect which were accomplished
using JavaScript, CSS3 transforms and transitions, and SVG elements.

The website can be found online at <http://techmine.heroku.com>.
